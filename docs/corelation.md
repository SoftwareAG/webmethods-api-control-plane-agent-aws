## Co-relation between Amazon API Gateway and API Control Plane terminologies

| Amazon API Gateway | API Control Plane | Description |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Stage |	Runtime Co-relation between Amazon API Gateway and API Control Plane terminologies | A stage in AWS API Gateway is considered as a runtime in API Control Plane. |
| Deployment | API Versions | A deployment is a snapshot of an API, which tracks the version of an API. <br><br> An API in AWS API Gateway can have multiple deployments. Whereas only one deployment can be active at any time in the stage. |



For AWS API Gateway, you must develop an Agent for each distinct Stage. For example:

If *API1* and *API2* are deployed across stages, *dev* and *qa* in *us-east-1* region under *account1*, 2 runtimes are required. That is, an Agent must be deployed for ‘dev’ and ‘qa’ each.

If *API3* is deployed across stages, *dev*, *pre-prod*, and *prod* in *us-east-2* region under *account1*, 3 more runtimes are required. That is, an Agent must be deployed for ‘dev’, ‘pre-prod, and ‘prod’ each.

If *API4* is deployed across stages, *dev* and *prod* in *us-east-1* region under *account2*, 2 additional runtimes are required. That is, an Agent must be deployed for ‘dev’ and ‘prod’ each.

The following figure helps you identify the distinct stage:
